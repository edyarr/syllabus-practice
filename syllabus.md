# **Introduction to Africana Studies**

## Course Information
Professor: Dr. Eduard Arriaga
Time: TBD
Office: ESCH 033G

## Course Description
This survey course introduces students to the content and methodologies of Africana Studies as an interdisciplinary field by discussing its genealogy, developments, and future challenges. With a main geographical focus on the Americas—United States, the Caribbean and Latin America-- the course will explore historical and contemporary experiences of African-descended peoples at both local and global levels. We will also study how these individuals and communities have invented, remembered, encountered and represented Africa to respond to phenomena such as the history of enslavement, colonialism, apartheid, racism, and globalization. In order to develop a critical understanding of the African Diaspora, students will have the opportunity to study not only literature and research, but also film, music, photography, performance, and artwork among others. In addition to building critical thinking skills, this course will allow students to develop and improve intercultural skills and awareness of global/local interconnections.

## Course Obejectives
After taking this course and completing satisfactorily all the required work, students will be able to:
- Identify genealogies, methodologies, and topics pertaining to the Africana Studies as interdisciplinary field.
- Interpret, critique, and analyze Africana cultural productions as outcomes of complex traditions of intercultural exchange.
- Link historical events to contemporary issues, adopting a critical and informed perspective about racial, ethnic, and intercultural relations 
- Deconstruct central concepts such as blackness, indigenity, diaspora, citizenship, and freedom, connected to connected to Africana Studies and to the experience of black communities in diverse geographical regions
- Develop skills as critical creators, writers, readers of texts, from a critical perspective that allow students see the interdependence o these skills

## Learning Outcomes
After taking this course and completing satisfactorily all the required work, students will achieve the following outcomes: 
- A general knowledge of the genealogies, methodologies and topics of Africana Studies as Interdisciplinary field
- The ability to interpret, critique, and analyze Africana cultural productions as outcomes of complex traditions of intercultural exchange

## Course Expectations
This is an introductory course to Africana Studies, which means there is not pre-requisites or expectation of previous knowledge. However, since this is a course devoted to discuss complex themes about race, ethnicity, and inter/cross-cultural experiences, it is expected that students come with an open mind. Likewise, as this is an academic course based on scientific and interdisciplinary approaches, students are expected to be prepared to use logic and well-founded arguments to discuss texts as well as the opinion of their peers. 

In this course we will read, write, and interact with diverse types of texts (video clips, music, film, photograph, digital texts, etc.) and cultural productions in order to learn and discuss the past, present and future of Africana Studies and Africana communities. Active participation and constant engagement with the readings, the texts, and the ideas exposed in class will be key in achieving course objectives and learning goals. Course meetings will combine lecture, discussion, and workshop/creative activities. Each class, we will use our required readings and a question/problem as starting point from which to critically examine a theme, event, figure, idea or some combination of the four.

## Course Evaluation
- Attendance & Participation (25%)
- Weekly Reading Respnse (30%)
- Presentation (20%)
- Final Project (25%)


## Attendance & Participation
You are required to attend every class, and be prepared to participate actively in all discussions and activities. Since our class is a combination of diverse pedagogical methods but centered around student participation, students are expected to have a leading role in reading, discussing, and presenting creative arguments. Ask questions, make comments, and go back to our readings as a way to generate conversation, achieve goals/objectives, and secure outstanding results in the class.

## Weekly Reading response
Each week, student must turn in a reading response that engages the major themes of the texts. These responses will allow students to reflect around a theme, an event, a figure, or the combination of the three, connecting main concepts of the reading to the reflection students may have around it. A good way to understand and reflect about a given text is to try to connect it to one’s own experience or contemporary events. That linkage will allow students to understand concepts from a more personal perspective without losing the academic and objective conception. Students may submit written journal entries, poetry, or any other form of composition, as long as it shows a deep process of thinking and reflection around the concepts and readings at hand. Responses are due the first meeting of the week at the beginning of class.  Weekly reflections are one-page long documents, double spaced, written using Time New Roman font, 12.

## Presentation
Students will choose a theme, an event or a figure of the Africana world to do research and prepare an oral group presentation in front of the class. The list of topics will be made available by your instructor the first week of the semester. Students must carry out research and turn in a written report (including a preliminary bibliography) prior to the presentation Presentations should be engaging and will be evaluated based on three main components: evidence of research (project report), reflection (reflective statements and connection with contemporary events/figures), use of presentational skills (performance). Do not relay on Power Point to make your presentations; use the various visual and audio archives from our class as well as other files you may have encountered in the research process.

## Final Project
Students will create a final project. Students can choose one of the following options. For both options, students may choose to extend the project developed for the oral presentation. If you do so, you need to make a stronger and deeper reflective component:
1.	Write a final paper in the form of journal article with a bibliography. Your paper must connect your overall experience in the course, your knowledge of one or two events, figures and/or ideas from the Africana world and your mastering of methodologies to study/critique the chosen topic. This is a research paper of 5-8 pages (not including the bibliography). Students must use MLA Researchers Format (8th Ed).

2.	Develop an audiovisual product (video/website) that connects your experience in the course, your knowledge of one or two events, figures and/or ideas from the Africana world, and your mastering of methodologies to study/critique the chosen topic. In addition, this project will have a reflective component through which you will link your knowledge to social, political and cultural struggle of contemporary Africana communities. Students who chose this option may also choose to work in a group but must submit an outline of the role of each group member.
